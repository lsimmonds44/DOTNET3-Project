# DOTNET3-Project
My .NET III final project, with ASP.NET front end.

The purpose of this application is to provide a resource for those interested in native plant and insect conservation. 
It allows users to search for plants and insects based on their growing zone and soil type.

The project features multi-user, n-tier, data-driven development with a hand-scripted database with data access through 
hand-coded stored procedures
